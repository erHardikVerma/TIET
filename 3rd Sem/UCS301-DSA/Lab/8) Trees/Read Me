The depth of a node is the number of edges present in path from the root node of a tree to that node.
The height of a node is the number of edges present in the longest path connecting that node to a leaf node.

Average Height of a BST with n nodes=O(log2n)
Worst Case height of a BST with n nodes=O(n)
